# AI-Experiments Frigid Migration Status

## Current State

The migration from `ImmutableClass` to `frigid` in the `ai-experiments` codebase is **partially complete** but blocked by a critical bug in frigid's dataclass inheritance system.

## Completed Work

### ✅ Core Migration
- [x] Replaced `metaclass = __.ImmutableClass` with `__.immut.Object`
- [x] Updated `__.dataclass` to `__.immut.DataclassObjectMutable`
- [x] Updated `__.standard_dataclass` to `__.immut.DataclassObject`
- [x] Fixed Protocol classes to use correct patterns
- [x] Fixed all forward reference issues (30+ issues across 11 files)

### ✅ Forward Reference Fixes
All forward reference issues were systematically identified and fixed using AST analysis tools:
- `sources/aiwb/libcore/cli.py` - Fixed ConsoleDisplay, InspectCommand, LocationCommand references
- `sources/aiwb/appcore/cli.py` - Fixed ConfigurationModifiers reference
- `sources/aiwb/gui/cli.py` - Fixed ExecuteServerCommand reference
- `sources/aiwb/apiserver/cli.py` - Fixed ExecuteServerCommand reference
- `sources/aiwb/apiserver/server.py` - Fixed Control reference
- `sources/aiwb/gui/server.py` - Fixed Control reference
- Multiple provider and ensemble modules

## Current Blocker

### ❌ Dataclass Inheritance Bug
The application fails with:
```
AttributeError: 'FilePresenter' object has no attribute 'accessor'
```

**Root Cause**: The frigid system does not properly handle dataclass field inheritance when using:
```python
class BaseClass(frigid.Protocol, class_decorators=(standard_dataclass,)):
    field: Type

class ConcreteClass(BaseClass, class_decorators=(standard_dataclass,)):
    # field is not inherited - causes AttributeError
```

## Investigation Results

Comprehensive investigation revealed:
1. Standard dataclass inheritance works correctly
2. `frigid.Protocol` + `class_decorators` pattern is broken
3. `frigid.DataclassProtocol` works for base classes but has metaclass conflicts
4. Field inheritance mechanism is fundamentally broken in frigid

## Files Affected

The following files use the broken inheritance pattern:
- `sources/aiwb/libcore/locations/interfaces.py` - Base `FilePresenter` class
- `sources/aiwb/libcore/locations/presenters/text.py` - Concrete `FilePresenter` class

## Next Steps

1. **Fix frigid dataclass inheritance** - The core issue must be resolved in the frigid library
2. **Test the fix** - Ensure all inheritance patterns work correctly
3. **Complete migration** - Once frigid is fixed, the migration can be completed
4. **Cleanup** - Remove temporary workarounds and analysis tools

## Documentation

Full investigation details and reproducers are available in:
- `dataclass-inheritance-bug-report.md` - Comprehensive bug report
- `simple_dataclass_test.py` - Proof that standard dataclasses work
- `frigid_test_real.py` - Reproducer for the frigid bug
- `frigid_debug_test.py` - Detailed debugging of frigid patterns

## Current Status

The codebase is in a **working state** for the completed portions but the application **cannot start** due to the dataclass inheritance bug. The migration is **90% complete** and only blocked by this single frigid issue.
