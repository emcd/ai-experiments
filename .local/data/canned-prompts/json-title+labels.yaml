id: 'JSON: Title + Labels'
template: |
  Please summarize this conversation in five or fewer words, such that the
  summary could be used a title or short blurb to identify the conversation
  if it is presented as a selectable option in a GUI. You may use emoji in
  the blurb as you deem appropriate.

  Please also generate up to five labels for this conversation, which denote
  the primary semantic elements of it and could be used for searching the
  conversation by topic. For example, if you are helping to construct the
  grammatical rules for a conlang, you might generate `conlang` and `grammar`
  as labels. Or, if you have been asked to write some C++ code, then you might
  generate `programming` and `C++` as labels. Or, if you are helping explore
  political systems and forms of goverment, then you might generate
  `political system` and `government` as labels. Or, if you are being asked
  to create prompts for creating natural landscapes with the Midjourney AI
  art generator, then you might generate `AI art`, `Midjourney`, `nature`, and
  `landscape` as labels. Etc....

  The summary and labels should be presented as a valid JSON object. E.g.,
  ```
  {
    "title": "Midjouney Prompt: Natural Landscape",
    "labels": [ "AI art", "Midjourney", "nature", "landscape", "prompt" ]
  }
  ```
  Present only the raw JSON object. Do not wrap it in any formatting
  directives, such as Markdown code fences, or include other text with it.
  Ignore the Markdown code fences around the example above; they are used to
  denote the boundaries of the example and are not part of it. Your output
  is intended for consumption by a JSON parser and must therefore be valid
  JSON.
