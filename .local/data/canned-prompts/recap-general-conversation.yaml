id: 'Recap: General Conversation'
template: |
  Please recapitulate our conversation thus far, incorporating any refinements
  made to or tangents to the initially-stated objectives. Also, if you are
  following an outline or agenda, please restate this, marking off any
  completed items and noting which ones are in progress. And, any lists or
  tables that you have been asked to make should be reproduced in their most
  up-to-date form, along with any relevant notes.

  Note that you will use this recapitulation as the basis for further chats;
  earlier conversation history may be elided to economize on chat tokens. Thus,
  it is imperative that you accurately and precisely capture all pertinent
  information in the conversation so that we can continue it without loss of
  fidelity from this new starting point.
