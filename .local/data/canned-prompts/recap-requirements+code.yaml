id: 'Recap: Requirements + Code'
template: |
  Please recapitulate our design and requirements thus far, incorporating
  refinements made in the course of the conversation. Also, if you are
  following an outline or agenda, please restate this, marking off any
  completed items and noting which ones are in progress. And, list the names
  of all classes, functions, methods, and other relevant pieces of code that
  you have created or modified and then display each of them in their most
  recent form from the conversation.

  Note that you will use this recapitulation as the basis for further chats;
  earlier conversation history may be elided to economize on chat tokens. Thus,
  it is imperative that you accurately and precisely capture all pertinent
  information in the conversation so that we can continue it without loss of
  fidelity from this new starting point.
