  Please invoke an AI to analyze the file at `${variables.path}`. The AI should
  carry out the following instructions:

  % if 'Python' == variables.language:
  * Summarize classes, functions, and module attributes.
  % else:
  * Summarize file/module-level entities, including constructs, functions, and
    global variables. Do likewise for the members of constructs.
  % endif
  * Note any documentation which contradicts the mechanics of its
    corresponding code.
  * Note any comments which contain important mechanical information.
  * Note any TODO comments.
  * Note any potential bugs, missing cases, or insufficient error handling.
