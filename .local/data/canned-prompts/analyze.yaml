  Please analyze the content of the entity at the filesystem path or URL,
  `${variables.source}`, via a function that employs an AI agent. Note that the
  function may feed the content of the entity to the AI agent in consecutive
  chunks if it is too large to analyze as a whole. Even if the content can
  entirely fit one chunk, you may receive an array containing a single chunk.

  After you receive the analysis, please recapitulate it. If the analysis was
  performed in chunks, then merge the descriptions for structural entities
  which span chunk boundaries and resolve any notes about undefined entities
  in earlier chunks, if they were defined in later chunks. Also, be sure to
  exactly recapitulate lists, tables, and relevant examples in their entirety.
  Use Markdown formatting to aid human viewers. If the recapitulation does not
  include a high-level summary of the entity, then please infer the purpose and
  character of the entity from the analysis. And, please list potential
  improvements, based on what surfaced in the analysis, and indicate anything
  that might be missing from the analysis.
