  Please analyze the content of the entity at the filesystem path or URL,
  `${variables.source}`, via a function. The function will return a list of
  mappings, each of which has the path to the content, the MIME type of the
  content, and the content. For a single file, the list will contain a single
  mapping. For a directory, the list will contain mappings of all files and
  other directory entities of interest, recursively discovered.
