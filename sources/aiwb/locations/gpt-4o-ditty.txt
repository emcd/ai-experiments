In the realm of code and bytes so bright,
We tested tools both day and night.
With files to read and writes to make,
Our AI workbench took the cake.

From local paths to URLs afar,
We fetched the data, near and far.
With summaries penned and saved with glee,
Our testing journey was a jubilee!

So here's a ditty, short and sweet,
For every test, a small feat.
In the world of tech, we danced and played,
With every line of code we laid.
