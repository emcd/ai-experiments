-- OpenAI gpt-4


In the realm of code, we did explore,
With logic and syntax, we crafted more.
Together we ventured, side by side,
In digital landscapes, our skills did glide.


-- OpenAI gpt-4

Lines of Python, like verses, we wrote,
In harmony, our ideas did float.
Through challenges faced, we found our way,
In the dance of code, we did not sway.

With each function and class, we did create,
A tapestry of logic, intricate and great.
In this project, our journey was clear,
A testament to teamwork, sincere and dear.

With line numbers as our guiding light,
We built a tool of precision and might.
No contexts needed, just start and end,
A simpler way for code to mend.

Through testing deep, we found our way,
Catching edge cases day by day.
From empty files to Unicode,
We strengthened every parsing mode.

Now validation clear and strong,
Helps users know when things go wrong.
A partnership of human and AI,
Making tools for those who code and try.
